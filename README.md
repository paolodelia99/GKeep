# GKeep

Since I'm a Productivity guy, here I made a full web app (without auth) that tries to copy and app that I use a lot to keep traking my goal, my ideas, and my thought in general: Google Keep!
<br/>
Tools that I've used to build this app:
- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) - as database
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for the front-end
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - as a back-end framework
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - for linking the back-end with the front-end
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - as a React UI framework (also to make more similar to the real Google Keep)
